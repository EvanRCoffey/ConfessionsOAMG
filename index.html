		<h1>Why write yet another Montessori blog?</h1>
		<br>
		<p>
			Hey, and welcome to Confessions of a Montessori guide. For many weeks I have been pondering this question of ‘why write about what others have already taken the time to write about?’
			<br><br>
			I feel strongly that in order to grow in this world we must be the ones to challenge ourselves. We find our areas for growth, we reflect on them, and we take the necessary steps to change our lives. I want to scare myself, and I hope by doing so I will gain courage and strength along the way. I have never been a talented writer. Yes, I would love to sit on the porch of a beach house tirelessly creating a life changing novel. Unfortunately, I lack the skill and drive to pursue this dream. For years I have worked through grammer books, all of which suggest the need for others to read your writing in order to improve. After almost ten years of avoiding this crucial step I am finally ready to take a giant leap out of my comfort zone. 
			<br><br>
			Another reason that hits close with me is the feeling that our country could benefit from more Montessorians speaking up about educating the child life instead of just a test score. The beauty of what we offer the children, and the skills they learn translate into a more peaceful world. The sad truth is many people have no clue they can offer they child something different. Including myself, I stumbled across Montessori while transitioning out of my master’s program in music performance and onto the next stage in my field. I was as clueless about Montessori as I was about how to write code in order to build this website. When we voice our passions others may take a second to listen, and the word of ‘following the child’ may spread like fire. 
			<br><br>
			I hope to find others who are passionate about moving our society forward and who believe the best way to do that is through educating our children. As a Montessorian in the public sector I believe building community is the best way to carry us through our most challenging times. We will all have different experiences yet by coming together we can push ourselves to grow more in our own journeys. Every person shapes their view of the world through their experiences, I would like to share mine. I have been in this field for just over 5 years, and there is still much more for me to learn, every week a child approaches me with a situation I have yet to experience. Through Confessions of a Montessori Guide I will discuss my experience, and send questions out to be answered. The more we can connect then the easier it will be for our voices to be heard. 
			<br><br>
			Please check in here and there to see what Confessions of a Montessori Guide brings to the table. As you will come accustomed to hearing I would like to pass the end of this first entry over to an incredible woman.
