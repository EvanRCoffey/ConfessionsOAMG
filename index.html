		<h1>Why write yet another Montessori blog?</h1>
		<br>
		<p>
			Hello, and welcome to Confessions of a Montessori Guide!  For many weeks, I have been pondering the question of ‘why write about what others have already taken the time to?’
			<br><br>
			I feel strongly that, in order to grow in this world, we must be the ones to challenge ourselves. We must find our areas for growth, reflect on them, and take the necessary steps to change our lives. I want to scare myself, and I hope by doing so I will gain courage and strength along the way. I have never been a talented writer. Sure, I would love to sit on the porch of a beach house, tirelessly creating a life-changing novel. Unfortunately, I lack the skill and drive to pursue this dream. For years, I have worked through grammar books, all of which suggest allowing others to read my writing. After almost ten years of avoiding this crucial step, I am finally ready to get out of my comfort zone. 
			<br><br>
			Another reason that hits close with me is the feeling that our country could benefit from more Montessorians speaking up about educating the child about life instead of just about a standardized test. The beauty of what we offer the children and the skills they learn translate into a more peaceful world. The sad truth is, many people have no clue they can offer they child something different. I am fortunate to have stumbled across Montessori while transitioning out of my master’s program in music performance and onto the next stage in that field. I was just as clueless about Montessori then as I am about how to write code in order to build this website, now. When we voice our passions, others may take a second to listen, and the word of ‘following the child’ may spread like fire. 
			<br><br>
			I hope to find others who are passionate about moving our society forward and who believe the best way to do that is through educating our children. As a Montessorian in the public sector, I believe building community is the best way to carry us through our most challenging times. We will all have different experiences in life, yet by coming together, we can push ourselves to grow more in our own journeys. Every person shapes their view of the world through their experiences, and I would like to share mine. I have been in this field for just over 5 years, and there is still much more for me to learn.  Every week a child approaches me with a situation I have yet to experience. Through Confessions of a Montessori Guide I will discuss my experience and send questions out to be answered. The more we can connect, the easier it will be for our voices to be heard. 
			<br><br>
			Please check in here and there to see what Confessions of a Montessori Guide brings to the table. As you will come accustomed to hearing, I would like to pass the end of this first entry over to an incredible woman:
