	Recently, I read an article in the online paper “Montessori Public” which focused on accommodations in the primary classroom. I loved how much of what the author suggested, we already know and do day to day in our environments. The section I was drawn to the most was for children with reading difficulties, and her solution was Explicit Spoken Language. Of course, as Montessorians we know the importance of spoken language. The tricky part is finding the time in our day to make these almost “invisible lessons” more present throughout the work cycle. One way of doing this that I absolutely LOVED was the idea of tongue twisters! The link directly below is to the Montessori Public online paper, and the article I am referring to is titled “Accommodations in Primary” by Julia Volkman and is on page 8:

	Below, you will find a very easy setup I put together for these to be ready for use on my spoken language shelf. I have been observing the children for four weeks with this activity, and I am happy with the results. I used pictures on the tongue twisters so children who are not yet reading could tell them apart. I noticed that the older friends would take out these tongue twisters and read them to their younger friends. Since using these, my entire classroom has not only exploded in spoken language, but some are even attempting to create their own twisters! Below you will find a quick tutorial on how I assembled the activity and a link to three tongue twisters you can print for free to get started in your own environment.

	<br>
	<p>
	First, I found free google images and pasted them into Microsoft word with the tongue twister, and then I printed them out on cardstock.

	<br>
	<p>
	Next, I cut the pages in half and took 1 inch off the top to make them a bit smaller. I then rounded the edges, because I always have a fear of my young friends poking themselves in the eyes with sharp edges.

	<br>
	<p>
	Finally, I laminated the pages and sewed an extremely easy pouch for them. You could always use a tray instead of a pouch!

	If you’d like to try this activity in your own room, you are more than welcome to use the link below for three of your own tongue twisters. I’d love to hear your favorite tongue twisters, songs, and poems you enjoy using in your own environment. Please send me any feedback on your observations of these activities. Remember, the most important thing is that we get our children talking!
